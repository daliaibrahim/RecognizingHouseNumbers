# RecognizingHouseNumbers
This algorithm uses a deep convolutional neural network to classify 32 X 32 images of house numbers. The [A4_Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/daliaibrahim/RecognizingHouseNumbers/blob/master/A4_Documentation.pdf) contains a description of the architecture used, the parameters and features selected, a sample image output, and a table with some of the architectures that were tested.
